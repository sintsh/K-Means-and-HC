# K-Means-and-HC

K-Means and hierarchical clustering

Clustering refers to dividing data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same
groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. For
this clustering or grouping to take place, clustering algorithms play a significant role.
